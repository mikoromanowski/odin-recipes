    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup warm water (110 degrees F/45 degrees C)</li>
        <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
        <li>4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup warm milk</li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>12 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups candied mixed fruit</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons orange zest</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg yolk</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon cream</li>
        <li>3 (7 x 4-inch) round paper panettone molds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make sponge, warm a small bowl by rinsing it with hot water. 
        Pour in warm water and sprinkle 1 package yeast on it. Let stand until yeast has dissolved. 
        Stir in 1/2 cup flour, cover with plastic wrap, and let stand 30 minutes, or until doubled.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle remaining yeast over warm milk. Let stand until dissolved. Beat together sugar, eggs, egg yolks, and vanilla. 
        Stir in milk-yeast mixture. Add sponge and stir until well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Combine butter and remaining 3 ½ cups flour until crumbly. Slowly pour in egg mixture and beat on high speed 3 to 4 minutes, 
        until dough is elastic looking and long strands form. Beat in fruit and zests.</li>
        <li>Turn dough into oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and leave in a warm place to rise until doubled, about 2 to 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Brush inside of three 7 x 4-inch paper molds with melted butter. 
        Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead a few times to deflate.</li>
        <li>Divide dough into 3 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and drop into prepared molds; 
        place on a baking sheet about 4-inches apart and cover loosely with plastic wrap. 
        Let rise in a warm place until doubled again, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut an X in top of each loaf with oiled scissors. 
        Combine egg yolk with cream. Brush tops of loaves lightly with egg wash.</li>
        <li>Place baking sheet with loaves in bottom 1/3 of preheated oven. After 10 minutes, lower heat to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
        Continue to bake for 30 more minutes; if tops get too brown, cover with foil. Loaves are done when a wooden skewer inserted into centers comes out clean. 
        Cool on wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
