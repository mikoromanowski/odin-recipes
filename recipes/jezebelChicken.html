    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>    
        <li>4 (6 ounce) skin-on, bone-in chicken thighs, patted dry</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons apple jelly</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons pineapple fruit preserves</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons prepared horseradish, or to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground dry mustard</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 large garlic clove, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, cubed</li>
        <li>chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly all over with salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.</li>
        <li>Arrange chicken skin-side down, in a single layer in a large skillet, and place skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, undisturbed, until skin is crispy and well browned, 6 to 9 minutes. Flip chicken over and cook until golden brown, 4 to 5 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to prevent overbrowning.
            Transfer chicken to a plate, skin-side up. Reserve 1 tablespoon drippings in skillet; discard remaining drippings. (See Note.)</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, stir together apple jelly, pineapple preserves, horseradish, dry mustard, crushed red pepper,
            and remaining 1/4 teaspoon black pepper in a small bowl until well combined for Jezebel sauce; set aside.</li>
        <li>Add shallot to drippings in the skillet and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until softened and fragrant,
            about 1 minute. Add green onions and garlic, and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chicken broth, scraping the bottom of the pan to loosen any brown bits.</li>
        <li>Stir prepared jelly mixture (Jezebel sauce) into skillet until combined. Return chicken to the skillet, skin side up. Bring to a simmer over medium heat and cook until a thermometer inserted into thickest portion of chicken registers at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), 8 to 10 minutes.
            Transfer chicken to a large plate. Continue to cook sauce, stirring frequently, until it can lightly coat the back of a spoon and hold a trail when a finger is run through, about 1 minute more. </li>
        <li>Stir in butter, swirling pan until combined, and sauce is glossy.</li>
        <li>Spoon Jezebel sauce over chicken. Garnish with parsley.</li>
    </ol>
